Crystal Collector game (1st attempt)
Homework #4

Instruction: You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 
By clicking on each crystal your goal is to match the random number provided.
You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. 
Each time when the game starts, the values of each crystal will change.
Good luck!
